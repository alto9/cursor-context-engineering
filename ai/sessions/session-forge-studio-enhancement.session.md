# Forge Studio Enhancement Session

## Problem Statement
Enhance Forge Studio with improved file management and session tracking capabilities to provide a more comprehensive context engineering experience for developers.

## Goals
- Improve Forge Studio dashboard with better project overview
- Enhance session management capabilities
- Add comprehensive file management features
- Implement proper build and packaging processes
- Create comprehensive data models for Forge objects
- Provide technical guidance through context files

## Design Decisions Made

### Studio Interface Enhancements
- Created comprehensive dashboard overview feature
- Implemented session management interface
- Added file management capabilities
- Integrated with VSCode theming system

### Technical Implementation
- Defined webpack build configuration for VSCode extension
- Created monorepo package management structure
- Implemented proper TypeScript configuration
- Added build optimization and development workflows

### Data Models
- Created comprehensive session model with file tracking
- Defined feature model with Gherkin scenario support
- Implemented story model for implementation tracking
- Added proper relationships and validation rules

### Context Guidance
- Created MCP server implementation guidance
- Added Gherkin scenario writing guidance
- Implemented Node.js development patterns
- Added VSCode extension theming guidance

## Files Created/Modified
- **Features**: Studio interface, dashboard, session management
- **Specs**: Build configuration, package management
- **Models**: Session, feature, story data structures
- **Contexts**: Technical guidance for implementation

## Next Steps
- Distill session into implementation stories
- Create tasks for manual configuration
- Implement stories with complete context
- Test and validate all enhancements
