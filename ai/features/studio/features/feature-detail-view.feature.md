# Feature Detail View

## Feature: View Feature Details

```gherkin
Feature: View Feature Details
  As a developer
  I want to see detailed information about a feature
  So that I can understand its behavior and requirements

  Scenario: Display feature information
    Given I have selected a feature from the list
    When I view the feature details
    Then I should see the feature name and description
    And I should see the linked spec IDs
    And I should see the linked model IDs
    And I should see the linked context IDs
    And I should see the Gherkin scenarios
    And I should see any additional notes or documentation

  Scenario: Navigate to feature from list
    Given I am viewing the features list
    When I click on a feature
    Then I should be taken to the feature detail view
    And I should see all feature information
    And I should be able to edit the feature if I have an active session

  Scenario: View feature in read-only mode
    Given I do not have an active session
    When I view a feature
    Then I should see all feature information
    And I should see that editing is disabled
    And I should see a message that an active session is required for editing
```

    And I should be returned to the features list

  Scenario: Navigate back to list
