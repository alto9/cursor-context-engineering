# Spec Detail View

## Feature: View Spec Details

```gherkin
Feature: View Spec Details
  As a developer
  I want to see detailed information about a spec
  So that I can understand the technical implementation requirements

  Scenario: Display spec information
    Given I have selected a spec from the list
    When I view the spec details
    Then I should see the spec name and description
    And I should see the linked feature IDs
    And I should see the linked model IDs
    And I should see the linked context IDs
    And I should see the Mermaid diagrams
    And I should see the implementation details
    And I should see any additional notes or documentation

  Scenario: Navigate to spec from list
    Given I am viewing the specs list
    When I click on a spec
    Then I should be taken to the spec detail view
    And I should see all spec information
    And I should be able to edit the spec if I have an active session

  Scenario: View spec in read-only mode
    Given I do not have an active session
    When I view a spec
    Then I should see all spec information
    And I should see that editing is disabled
    And I should see a message that an active session is required for editing
```

    Then I should see that editing is disabled
    And I should see a message to start a session first

  Scenario: Delete spec from detail view
    Given I am viewing a spec
    When I want to delete the spec
    Then I should be able to click "Delete" button
    And I should be prompted to confirm deletion
    And the spec should be deleted
    And I should be returned to the specs list

  Scenario: Navigate back to list
    Given I am viewing a spec
    When I want to go back to the specs list
    Then I should be able to click "Back" or use breadcrumb navigation
    And I should be returned to the specs list
    And the list should maintain its previous state
