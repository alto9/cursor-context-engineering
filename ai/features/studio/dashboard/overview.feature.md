Feature: Project Overview Dashboard
  As a developer
  I want to see a comprehensive overview of my Forge project
  So that I can understand the current state and navigate efficiently

  Scenario: View project statistics
    Given I have a Forge project with various files
    When I open the Forge Studio dashboard
    Then I should see count cards for all Forge object types:
      | Sessions | Total number of sessions |
      | Features | Total number of feature files |
      | Specs | Total number of spec files |
      | Models | Total number of model files |

      | Contexts | Total number of context files |

      | Tasks | Total number of task files |
    And counts should be calculated recursively from ai/ directory
    And counts should update automatically when files change

  Scenario: View active session on dashboard
    Given I have an active design session
    When I view the dashboard
    Then I should see an active session card prominently displayed
    And the card should show the session ID
    And the card should show the problem statement
    And the card should show when the session started
    And the card should show how many files have changed
    And I should see a "Stop Session" button

  Scenario: Stop session from dashboard

    When I click "Stop Session"
    Then the session should be completed
    And the session status should change to "completed"
    And the end time should be recorded
    And the active session card should disappear
    And the session count should update

  Scenario: View dashboard without active session
    Given I do not have an active session
    When I view the dashboard
    Then I should not see an active session card
    And I should see the count cards
    And I should see quick start instructions
    And I should be prompted to start a session to begin work

  Scenario: Navigate to different sections
    Given I am on the dashboard
    When I want to work with specific Forge objects
    Then I should see a sidebar with navigation links
    And I should be able to click Dashboard to return to overview
    And I should be able to click Sessions to manage sessions
    And I should be able to click Features to browse features
    And I should be able to click Specifications to browse specs
    And I should be able to click Models to browse models
