# Studio Session Management

## Feature: Session Management Interface

```gherkin
Feature: Session Management in Studio
  As a developer
  I want to manage design sessions through Forge Studio
  So that I can track my design work effectively

  Scenario: View all sessions
    Given I have multiple design sessions
    When I navigate to the Sessions section in Studio
    Then I should see all sessions with their status
    And I should see active sessions at the top
    And I should see completed sessions below
    And I should see session problem statements
    And I should see session start and end times

  Scenario: Start a new session
    Given I want to begin a new design session
    When I click "Start New Session" in Studio
    Then I should be prompted for a problem statement
    And I should be able to enter a clear description
    And a new session file should be created
    And the session should be marked as active
    And I should be taken to the new session

  Scenario: End an active session
    Given I have an active design session
    When I want to end the session
    Then I should be able to click "End Session"
    And the session status should be updated to completed
    And the end time should be recorded
    And I should be able to distill the session into stories
```

## Feature: Session Details

```gherkin
Feature: Session Details View
  As a developer
  I want to see detailed information about a session
  So that I can understand what was accomplished

  Scenario: View session details
    Given I have a completed design session
    When I click on the session in Studio
    Then I should see the problem statement
    And I should see all files that were changed
    And I should see the timeline of changes
    And I should see linked features, specs, and models
    And I should be able to distill the session

  Scenario: Distill session into stories
    Given I have a completed design session
    When I click "Distill Session" in Studio
    Then the system should analyze all changed files
    And create minimal implementation stories
    And create tasks for non-code work
    And place them in the tickets folder
    And I should be able to view the generated stories
```
