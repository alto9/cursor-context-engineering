# Forge Core Features

## Background

```gherkin
Background: Forge Context Engineering System
  Given a developer working on a software project
  And they need to manage context engineering for AI-assisted development
  And they want to convert design decisions into actionable implementation stories
  When they use Forge
  Then they should have a session-driven workflow
  And they should be able to organize features, specs, models, and contexts
  And they should be able to distill sessions into minimal implementation stories
```

## Rules

```gherkin
Rule: Session-Driven Workflow
  Given a developer using Forge
  When they start a design session
  Then all file changes should be tracked
  And they should be able to distill the session into stories and tasks
  And stories should be minimal and focused (< 30 minutes implementation)

Rule: Nestable Organization
  Given any folder in the ai/ structure
  When organizing related concepts
  Then folders should be nestable
  And index.md files should provide shared context
  And linkages between files should be maintained

Rule: Minimal Story Size
  Given a design session with multiple changes
  When distilling into implementation stories
  Then each story should be minimal and focused
  And complex changes should be broken into multiple stories
  And each story should have clear acceptance criteria
```
