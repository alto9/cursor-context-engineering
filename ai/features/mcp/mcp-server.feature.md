# MCP Server Implementation

## Feature: MCP Server Core Functionality

```gherkin
Feature: MCP Server Core Functionality
  As an AI assistant
  I want to access Forge capabilities via MCP
  So that I can help developers with context engineering

  Scenario: Get Forge workflow overview
    Given an AI assistant needs Forge guidance
    When they call get_forge_about
    Then they should receive comprehensive workflow overview
    And they should understand session-driven approach
    And they should know when to create Stories vs Tasks
    And they should receive minimal story size guidance

  Scenario: Get schema for file types
    Given an AI assistant needs to understand Forge file formats
    When they call get_forge_schema with a file type
    Then they should receive the schema for that file type
    And they should understand the required fields
    And they should know the content structure
    And they should understand linkage rules

  Scenario: Get technical guidance
    Given an AI assistant needs guidance on a technical object
    When they call get_forge_context with a spec object
    Then they should receive guidance for that object
    Or they should receive a research prompt if guidance doesn't exist
    And they should understand how to use the guidance

  Scenario: List supported objects
    Given an AI assistant needs to know what objects are supported
    When they call get_forge_objects
    Then they should receive a list of supported spec objects
    And they should understand what guidance is available
    And they should know how to use the objects
```

## Feature: MCP Tool Implementation

```gherkin
Feature: MCP Tool Implementation
  As a developer
  I want to implement MCP tools properly
  So that AI assistants can use Forge capabilities effectively

  Scenario: Implement tool with proper validation
    Given you are implementing an MCP tool
    When creating the tool handler
    Then use Zod schemas for parameter validation
    And implement proper error handling
    And return structured responses
    And handle file system errors gracefully

  Scenario: Handle tool calls asynchronously
    Given you are implementing MCP tools
    When handling tool calls
    Then use async/await for file operations
    And implement proper timeout handling
    And handle Promise rejections
    And return consistent response formats
```
