# Example Plan Prompts

## Phase Readiness Assessment
- `Review the Roadmap.md file and help me determine if Phase 1 is ready for detailed planning`
- `Analyze the dependencies in Phase 2 and verify we have all prerequisite information before planning`
- `Check if we have sufficient context in Context.md to begin planning Phase 3 implementation tasks`
- `Review completion criteria for Phase 1 and confirm we can create actionable tasks using the Task.md format`

## Context Collection
- `Search for best practices for AWS Lambda error handling and add them to Context.md`
- `Find examples of API gateway integration patterns and add relevant links to Context.md`
- `Gather documentation about monitoring solutions for serverless architectures in Context.md`
- `Add security compliance requirements and implementation guides to Context.md for authentication tasks`

## Task Planning
- `Help me break down Phase 1's authentication requirements into high-level implementation tasks using the Task.md format`
- `Create a logical task sequence for database implementation in Phase 2 using the Task.md format`
- `Plan the deployment pipeline tasks for Phase 1, including testing requirements`
- `Define integration tasks between the API Gateway and Lambda functions`

## Context Association
- `Review Phase 1 tasks and suggest relevant context links from Context.md`
- `Match AWS Lambda best practices from Context.md to our serverless implementation tasks`
- `Associate security documentation references with authentication-related tasks`
- `Link relevant API design patterns to our endpoint implementation tasks`

## Dependency Management
- `Analyze Phase 1 tasks and identify any missing dependencies`
- `Review task order in Phase 2 and ensure prerequisites are properly sequenced`
- `Check infrastructure dependencies for deployment tasks`
- `Validate that shared component tasks are ordered correctly across phases`

## Validation and Review
- `Review Phase 1 tasks against PRD.md requirements and ensure coverage`
- `Check Phase 2 tasks against TRD.md architecture decisions`
- `Verify that all Phase 1 tasks have necessary context references and follow the Task.md format`
- `Validate that monitoring and observability tasks align with requirements`

## Task Refinement
- `Help me add more detail to the authentication implementation tasks`
- `Review database tasks and ensure they include all necessary setup steps`
- `Expand deployment pipeline tasks to include specific testing stages`
- `Add context hints to the API implementation tasks about error handling`
