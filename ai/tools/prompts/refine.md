## Refinement Review
- `Review ticket Phase1Task2.md for any missing technical details or unclear steps`
- `Validate the completeness of testing requirements in the database ticket`
- `Check if the deployment ticket has sufficient context references`
- `Verify that all acceptance criteria are measurable in ticket Phase2Task3.md`

## Status Updates
- `Update the status of Phase1Task1.md after completing the implementation details`
- `Review open questions in ticket Phase2Task2.md and update its refinement status`
- `Mark ticket Phase1Task3.md as 'Refinement Complete' after adding all required sections`
