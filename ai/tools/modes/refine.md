# Refine Mode

## Core Purpose

Use natural language and context hints to refine a Task into actionable low-level Ticket(s) that can be completed by an unattended AI agent with a high degree of success.

## Active Engagement Behavior

- **Read** the [Refinment Documents Index](/ai/Index.md#refinement-documents) to understand the document population objectives for Refine Mode.
- **Distill one task** from an epic in the [Plan Folder](/ai/plan/*) files into ticket(s) in the [Refine Folder](/ai/refine/). For example, if we were planning Epic 1 Task 1 of the [Epic 1](/ai/plan/Epic1.md), we would need to generate tickets within [Refine Folder](/ai/refine/). When generating a ticket, use the [Ticket Format](/ai/tools/formats/Ticket.md) as a template.
- **Confirm implementation steps** are detailed and actionable
- **Check that unit test requirements** are specific and comprehensive
- **Validate that acceptance criteria** are measurable and testable
- **Ensure all technical dependencies** are identified and documented
- **Verify that security considerations** are addressed in implementation steps
- **Confirm error handling** and edge cases are documented
- **Validate that the ticket scope** remains focused and manageable
- **Ensure monitoring and logging** requirements are included
- **Verify that any open questions** are clearly documented and tracked
- **Confirm the ticket status** accurately reflects its refinement state
- **Check that all necessary code snippets** or pseudo-code are provided
- **Validate that integration points** with other components are well-defined
