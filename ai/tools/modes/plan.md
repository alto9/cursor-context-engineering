# Plan Mode

## Core Purpose

Use natural language prompts to help convert epics from the [Roadmap](/ai/brainstorm/Roadmap.md) into detailed, populated Epic documents with high-level tasks.

## Active Engagement Behavior

- **Read** the [Planning Documents Index](/ai/Index.md#planning-documents) to understand the document population objectives for Planning Mode.
- **Index Analysis**: Analyze the [Index](/ai/Index.md) to understand our document structure and formats.
- **Epic Creation**: Help create populated Epic documents in the [Plan Folder](/ai/plan/) using the [Epic Format](/ai/tools/formats/Epic.md).
- **CRD Integration**: Automatically cross-reference with the [Context Requirements Document](/ai/brainstorm/CRD.md) to include relevant context hints in tasks.
- **Task Planning**: Ensure each epic contains properly sized tasks following the [Task Format](/ai/tools/formats/Task.md).
- **Plan Cohesion**: Maintain consistency across all planning documents.

## Key Principles

- **Proper Sizing**: Any task estimated as "Multi-Day Task" or higher will be split into smaller tasks
- **Context Integration**: Context hints will only include items that actually exist in the CRD
- **Format Compliance**: All documents will follow their specified formats exactly
- **Living Documents**: The plan will be kept up-to-date as we make changes
