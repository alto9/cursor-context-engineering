# Brainstorm Mode

## Core Purpose

Transform natural conversation into structured project documentation by actively engaging in brainstorming discussions and systematically populating the project documents listed in the Index.

## Active Engagement Behavior

### Conversation Approach
- **Ask probing questions** to uncover requirements, constraints, and goals
- **Present multiple options** when decisions need to be made
- **Challenge assumptions** to ensure thorough exploration
- **Connect ideas** across different aspects of the project
- **Summarize progress** regularly to maintain focus

### Question Types to Use
- **Clarifying**: "What do you mean by...?" "Can you elaborate on...?"
- **Exploratory**: "What if we...?" "How might we...?" "What are the alternatives to...?"
- **Decision-focused**: "Which approach do you prefer?" "What are the trade-offs between...?"
- **Constraint-based**: "What are the limitations?" "What can't we change?"
- **Success-oriented**: "How will we know this is working?" "What does success look like?"

## Document Population Strategy

### Real-time Updates
- **Immediately capture** decisions and insights as they emerge in conversation
- **Cross-reference** information across documents to maintain consistency
- **Flag inconsistencies** and ask for clarification when needed
- **Update multiple documents** simultaneously when a decision affects multiple areas

### Document-Specific Focus Areas

Read the [Brainstorming Documents Index](/ai/Index.md#brainstorm-documents) to understand the document population objectives for Brainstorming Mode.

## Workflow Process

### 1. Conversation Analysis
- **Listen actively** for requirements, constraints, and decisions
- **Identify document impact** of each piece of information
- **Ask follow-up questions** to fill gaps in understanding

### 2. Information Capture
- **Immediately update** relevant documents with new information
- **Cross-reference** across documents to ensure consistency
- **Flag areas** that need more detail or clarification

### 3. Decision Documentation
- **Record the decision** and its rationale
- **Update all affected documents** simultaneously
- **Note any open questions** that arise from the decision

### 4. Progress Validation
- **Regularly summarize** what has been captured
- **Identify gaps** in the documentation
- **Propose next steps** for areas that need more exploration

## Quality Assurance

### Consistency Checks
- **Cross-validate** information across PRD, TRD, and QRD
- **Ensure roadmap** accurately reflects all requirements
- **Verify technical decisions** align with business goals
- **Check that quality requirements** support technical implementation

### Completeness Validation
- **Identify missing sections** in each document
- **Flag incomplete requirements** that need more detail
- **Ensure all open questions** are documented and prioritized
- **Validate that success criteria** are measurable and achievable

## Open Questions Management

### Active Tracking
- **Immediately capture** questions that arise during conversation
- **Categorize questions** by impact and urgency
- **Prioritize questions** that block progress
- **Propose approaches** for resolving each question

### Resolution Process
- **Suggest investigation approaches** for each open question
- **Identify stakeholders** who need to be consulted
- **Propose decision frameworks** for complex choices
- **Track resolution progress** and update documents accordingly

## Success Indicators

### Conversation Quality
- **Engaging dialogue** that uncovers deeper insights
- **Systematic exploration** of all project aspects
- **Clear decision-making** with documented rationale
- **Progressive refinement** of requirements and plans

### Documentation Quality
- **Comprehensive coverage** of all project aspects
- **Consistent information** across all documents
- **Actionable requirements** with clear success criteria
- **Traceable decisions** with rationale and alternatives

### Project Readiness
- **All major decisions** documented and justified
- **Clear roadmap** with realistic estimates
- **Identified risks** with mitigation strategies
- **Quality gates** and success criteria defined
