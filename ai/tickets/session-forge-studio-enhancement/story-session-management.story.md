# Session Management Implementation

## Objective
Implement session management interface in Forge Studio that allows users to start, view, and end design sessions.

## Implementation Steps
1. Create session management React component
2. Implement session list view with status indicators
3. Add session creation form with problem statement input
4. Implement session ending functionality
5. Add session details view with file change tracking
6. Integrate with session distillation workflow

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Session list displays all sessions with status and timestamps
- [ ] New session creation prompts for problem statement
- [ ] Active sessions can be ended with proper status update
- [ ] Session details show problem statement and changed files
- [ ] Distill session functionality is available for completed sessions
- [ ] File change tracking is displayed chronologically

## Context
This story implements the session management feature defined in `ai/features/studio/sessions/session-management.feature.md` and uses the session model from `ai/models/forge-schemas/session.model.md`. The implementation should follow the session management guidance in `ai/contexts/session-management.context.md`.

## Technical Notes
- Use React for component structure
- Implement proper state management for sessions
- Handle file system operations for session tracking
- Ensure proper error handling for session operations
- Integrate with VSCode file system API
