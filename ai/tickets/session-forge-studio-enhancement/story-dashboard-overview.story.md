# Dashboard Overview Implementation

## Objective
Implement the Forge Studio dashboard overview component that displays project statistics and provides navigation to different sections.

## Implementation Steps
1. Create dashboard React component with project statistics
2. Implement navigation to different Forge sections
3. Add recent activity display
4. Integrate with VSCode theming system
5. Add responsive design for different screen sizes

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dashboard displays counts of all Forge object types
- [ ] Navigation links work to all sections (Sessions, Features, Specs, Models, Actors, Contexts)
- [ ] Recent activity is displayed with timestamps
- [ ] Theme integration works with VSCode light/dark themes
- [ ] Responsive design works on different screen sizes
- [ ] Quick actions are available from dashboard

## Context
This story implements the dashboard overview feature defined in `ai/features/studio/dashboard/overview.feature.md` and uses the dashboard UI spec from `ai/specs/build/webpack.spec.md`. The implementation should follow the theming guidance in `ai/contexts/vscode/theme.context.md`.

## Technical Notes
- Use React for component structure
- Implement proper state management
- Handle VSCode theme changes dynamically
- Ensure accessibility compliance
- Use esbuild for webview bundling
