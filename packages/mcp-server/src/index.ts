## Overview
Forge is a comprehensive workflow system for structured context engineering in AI-assisted development. It uses a session-driven approach to manage design decisions and convert them into actionable implementation steps.

## Core Philosophy
1. **Accurate Context Without Overload** - Provide exactly what's needed, when it's needed
2. **Session-Driven Design** - Track all changes made during design sessions
3. **Minimal Story Size** - Keep implementation stories small, focused, and actionable
4. **Nestable Organization** - Use folder hierarchies to organize related concepts

## File Structure
\`\`\`

└── ai/
    ├── sessions/     # Design session tracking (nestable)
    ├── features/     # Feature definitions with Gherkin (nestable, index.md at each level)
    ├── specs/        # Technical specifications with Mermaid (nestable)

    ├── tickets/      # Implementation Stories and Tasks (nestable, organized by session)
    └── docs/         # Supporting documentation
\`\`\`

## The Forge Workflow

### Phase 1: Start a Design Session
1. User starts a session from Forge Studio or command
2. Session file created in \`ai/sessions/\` with problem statement
3. Session begins tracking all file changes

### Phase 2: Design Changes
During an active session:
- Edit Features: Define or modify feature behavior using Gherkin
- Edit Specs: Create or update technical specifications with Mermaid diagrams
- Edit Models: Define data structures and their properties
- Edit Actors: Define actors and their roles in the system
- Edit Contexts: Add guidance for specific technical areas
- All changes are tracked in the session's changed_files array

### Phase 3: Distill Session
When design is complete:
1. User runs "Distill Session" command
2. System generates a comprehensive prompt that:
   - Calls \`get_forge_about\` to understand the workflow
   - Analyzes all changed features/specs/models
   - Follows context linkages to gather necessary information
   - Creates Stories (code changes) and Tasks (non-code work)
   - Places them in \`ai/tickets/<session-id>/\`

### Phase 4: Build Implementation
1. User selects a Story from the tickets folder
2. Runs "Build Story" command
3. System generates prompt with full context to implement the story

## Stories vs Tasks

### Stories (*.story.md)
- Code changes and implementation work
- Require development and testing
- Should be MINIMAL in scope - one focused change
- Located in \`ai/tickets/<session-id>/\`
- Example: "Add email validation to User model"

### Tasks (*.task.md)
- Non-code work external to the system
- Manual processes, configuration, documentation
- No implementation in codebase
- Located in \`ai/tickets/<session-id>/\`
- Example: "Configure AWS IAM role in console"

## Key Principles for Distillation

When distilling a session into Stories and Tasks:

1. **Call get_forge_schema** - Validate all file formats
2. **Keep Stories Minimal** - One story should take < 30 minutes to implement
3. **Break Down Large Changes** - Split complex features into multiple stories
4. **Use Proper Linkages** - Link stories to features, specs, and models
5. **Follow Context Rules** - Check context files for guidance on technical approaches
6. **Verify Completeness** - Ensure all changed files are accounted for in stories/tasks

## Gherkin Format

All Gherkin scenarios MUST use code blocks for consistency:

\`\`\`gherkin
Feature: User Authentication

Scenario: Successful login
  Given a registered user with email "user@example.com"
  When they enter valid credentials
  Then they should be logged into the system
  And receive a session token
\`\`\`

## Index Files

Every Features folder should contain an \`index.md\` with:
- Frontmatter with folder-level metadata
- Background (Gherkin) - shared context for all features in folder
- Rules (Gherkin) - business rules that apply to all features in folder

## Best Practices

1. **Nested Organization** - Group related features/specs in folders
2. **Context Links** - Use context files to avoid repeating technical guidance
3. **Model-First** - Define data models before specs that use them
4. **Iterative Sessions** - Keep sessions focused on one problem area
5. **Clear Naming** - Use descriptive kebab-case IDs for all files

## Output Expectations

When distilling, the AI should:
- Create multiple small stories rather than one large story
- Link each story to relevant features, specs, and models
- Include specific file paths and clear objectives
- Add acceptance criteria to verify completion
- Order stories logically with dependencies
- Create tasks for any manual/external work

This workflow ensures that implementation has complete, accurate context without information overload.`;

changed_files: [
  "ai/features/user/authentication.feature.md",
  "ai/specs/api/auth-endpoint.spec.md",
  "ai/models/user.model.md"
]
---

## Content Structure
The session document should describe:

1. **Problem Statement** - What problem are we solving?
2. **Goals** - What are we trying to achieve?
3. **Approach** - High-level approach to the solution
4. **Key Decisions** - Important decisions made during the session
5. **Notes** - Additional context, concerns, or considerations

## Workflow
1. Session starts with problem_statement and start_time
2. During session, changed_files array tracks all modifications
3. Session ends with end_time and status: completed
4. Distillation creates Stories and Tasks in ai/tickets/<session-id>/

## Linkages
- Sessions generate **story** and **task** files in ai/tickets/<session-id>/
- Stories and tasks reference the session_id
- Changed files are analyzed during distillation`,

---

## Content Structure
Feature files use Gherkin format in code blocks:

\`\`\`gherkin
Feature: User Login

Background:
  Given the user authentication system is available
  And the database is accessible

Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
  Given a registered user with email "user@example.com"
  And the user has a valid password
  When they submit their credentials
  Then they should be logged into the system
  And receive a session token
  And be redirected to the dashboard

Scenario: Failed login with invalid password
  Given a registered user with email "user@example.com"
  When they submit an incorrect password
  Then they should see an error message
  And remain on the login page
  And no session should be created
\`\`\`

## Index Files (index.md)
Every features folder should have an index.md with:

---
title: "User Management Features"
description: "All features related to user management"
---

\`\`\`gherkin
Background:
  Given the application is running
  And user data is properly seeded

Rule: All user operations require authentication
  Example: Viewing user profile
    Given an authenticated user
    When they view their profile
    Then they should see their information

Rule: Email addresses must be unique
  Example: Duplicate email registration
    Given a user with email "user@example.com" exists
    When another user tries to register with "user@example.com"
    Then the registration should fail

- [ ] Another verifiable outcome

## Task Types

### External
Work done outside the codebase (e.g., cloud console configuration, third-party service setup)

### Manual
Manual processes that can't be automated yet

### Documentation
Creating or updating documentation that isn't code comments

### Configuration
Configuration changes in external systems

## Linkages
- References a **session_id** (required)
- No code dependencies - these are external/manual work items`,

      context: `# Context File Schema

## File Format
- **Filename**: <context-id>.context.md
- **Location**: ai/contexts/ (nestable)
- **Format**: Frontmatter + Gherkin Scenarios

## Frontmatter Fields
---
context_id: kebab-case-id  # Must match filename without .context.md
category: technical  # technical, business, process, tool
---

## Content Structure
Context files provide guidance on when and how to use specific information or tools. Use Gherkin format in code blocks:

\`\`\`gherkin
Scenario: Using TypeScript guidance
  Given we are implementing a feature in TypeScript
  When information is needed about TypeScript best practices
  Then read the document at ai/docs/typescript-guide.md
  And follow the coding standards defined there

Scenario: Using AWS CDK guidance
  Given we are implementing infrastructure with AWS CDK
  When information is needed about CDK patterns
  Then use the aws_cdk_guidance MCP tool
  And apply the recommended patterns from the response

Scenario: External API research
  Given a feature requires integration with a third-party API
  When implementation details are needed
  Then perform web search for the official API documentation
  And verify the API version matches our requirements
  And document the findings in ai/docs/
\`\`\`

## Purpose
Context files prevent information overload by providing just-in-time guidance:
- When to consult documentation
- Which tools to use for specific technologies
- Where to find additional information
- Research strategies for unknown technologies

## Linkages
- Referenced by **spec_id** and **story_id** values
- May reference documentation in ai/docs/
- May reference MCP tools or external resources`,
    };

    const schema = schemas[schemaType];
    if (!schema) {
      throw new Error(`Unknown schema type: ${schemaType}`);
    }

    return schema;
  }

  private getForgeContext(specObject: string): string {
    const items = this.readGuidanceIndex();
    const requested = this.normalizeObjectId(specObject);

    // Attempt to find a matching guidance file by id or alias
    const match = items.find((it) => it.id === requested || it.aliases.includes(requested));
    if (match) {
      try {
        const content = fs.readFileSync(match.filePath, 'utf8');
        return content;
      } catch {
        // Fall through to research prompt if file cannot be read
      }
    }

    return `# Research Prompt for: ${specObject}

You need to research and understand "${specObject}" to properly implement or work with it in the current project context.

## Research Instructions

Execute the following research steps in order:

### 1. Check Project Documentation
First, search the project's ai/docs/ directory for any existing documentation about "${specObject}":
- Look for markdown files that might contain relevant information
- Check for naming patterns that relate to this object

### 2. Search Codebase
Use codebase_search to find existing implementations or references:
- Query: "How is ${specObject} implemented in this codebase?"
- Query: "Where is ${specObject} used?"
- Review the results to understand current usage patterns

### 3. External Research (if needed)
If the above steps don't provide sufficient information, perform web research:
- Search for official documentation for "${specObject}"
- Look for best practices and common patterns
- Find implementation examples and tutorials
- Check for version-specific considerations

### 4. Synthesize Findings
After gathering information, create a summary that includes:
- **Definition**: What is ${specObject}?
- **Purpose**: Why is it used?
- **Implementation**: How should it be implemented in this project?
- **Best Practices**: What are the recommended approaches?
- **Gotchas**: What are common pitfalls to avoid?
- **Dependencies**: What does it depend on or integrate with?

### 5. Create Context (if needed)
If this is a recurring concept that will be needed in multiple stories, consider creating a context file at:
ai/contexts/${specObject.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, '-')}-guidance.context.md

This context file should follow the context schema and provide Gherkin scenarios for when and how to use this information in future work.

## Output Format
Provide your research findings in a structured format that can be easily referenced during implementation. Include specific code examples, configuration patterns, and integration points relevant to this project.

**Note**: This is a research prompt. Execute each step thoroughly before proceeding to implementation. Document your findings for future reference.`;
