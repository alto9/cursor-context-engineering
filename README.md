# Forge - Context Engineering for Agentic Development

A comprehensive toolkit for structured context engineering in AI-assisted development. Forge provides both a VSCode extension and an MCP server to help engineers create well-structured prompts with complete context.

## 🎯 What is Forge?

Forge is a session-driven workflow system for structured context engineering in AI-assisted development. It helps you design software systematically by tracking changes during design sessions, then distills those sessions into minimal, actionable implementation stories (< 30 minutes each) with complete context.

## 📦 Packages

This is a monorepo containing two packages:

### [@forge/vscode-extension](./packages/vscode-extension/)
VSCode extension that provides commands for session-driven design and implementation.

**Features:**
- Start and manage design sessions
- Forge Studio - Full-featured UI for creating and managing Forge files
  - Create features, specs, models, actors, and contexts
  - Create and navigate nested folder structures
  - Edit files with proper frontmatter and content templates
  - Session-aware workflows (requires active session for editing)
- Distill sessions into Stories and Tasks
- Build stories with complete context
- Right-click context menu integration

### [@forge/mcp-server](./packages/mcp-server/)
Model Context Protocol server that exposes Forge capabilities to AI assistants like Claude Desktop and Cursor.

**Tools:**
- `get_forge_about` - Comprehensive workflow overview and guidance
- `get_forge_schema` - Schema definitions for sessions, features, specs, models, actors, contexts, stories, and tasks
- `get_forge_context` - Technical object research prompts and guidance
- `get_forge_objects` - List supported spec objects from guidance library

## 🏗️ Project Structure

When you use Forge in a project, it manages files in a nestable folder structure:

```
your-project/
└── ai/
    ├── sessions/      # Design session tracking (*.session.md)
    ├── features/      # Feature definitions with Gherkin (*.feature.md, nestable, index.md)
    ├── specs/         # Technical specifications with Mermaid (*.spec.md, nestable)
    ├── models/        # Data model definitions (*.model.md, nestable)
    ├── actors/        # Actor/persona definitions (*.actor.md, nestable)
    ├── contexts/      # Context references and guidance (*.context.md, nestable)
    ├── tickets/       # Implementation Stories and Tasks (*.story.md, *.task.md, by session)
    └── docs/          # Supporting documentation
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/alto9/cursor-context-engineering.git
cd cursor-context-engineering

# Install dependencies for all packages
npm install

- Persistent session panel for real-time editing
- Auto-tracked file changes during sessions
- Document goals, approach, key decisions, and notes
- Auto-save with 500ms debounce
- Resume sessions across Studio reopens (filesystem is source of truth)
- End sessions and distill into stories

**File Management:**
- **Dashboard** - View session status and counts of all Forge objects (sessions, features, specs, models, actors, contexts, stories, tasks)
- **Sessions Page** - Create, view, and manage all design sessions
- **Category Pages** - Browse and edit Features, Specs, Models, Actors, and Contexts
- **Folder Navigation** - Tree view with expand/collapse, nested folder support

- **File Editing** - Edit frontmatter metadata and content (requires active session)
- **Gherkin Editor** - Structured visual editor for feature files with Background, Rules, and Scenarios
- **Read-Only Mode** - View files without active session, edit when session is active

**UI Features:**
- Three-panel layout (navigation sidebar, main content, session panel)
- Split view for browsing (folder tree + content)
- Real-time updates when files change on disk
- Automatic theme integration with VSCode
- Minimizable session panel

### Using the MCP Server

Add to your MCP settings file:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "forge": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/cursor-context-engineering/packages/mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/your/project"
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Objective
Add email validation to User model

## Implementation Steps
1. Add validation function
2. Update tests
3. Apply to registration endpoint

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Valid emails pass validation
- [ ] Invalid emails are rejected
```

## 🔄 The Forge Workflow

1. **Start a Session** - Begin a design session with a clear problem statement
2. **Design Changes** - Edit features, specs, models, and contexts during the active session
3. **Distill to Stories & Tasks** - Convert the session into minimal implementation stories (< 30 min each) and external tasks
4. **Build Stories** - Implement each story with complete context from linked features, specs, and models

The session-driven approach ensures changes are tracked systematically, and distillation creates focused, actionable stories with all necessary context.

## 💡 Why Forge?

Traditional prompting can be ad-hoc and miss important context. Forge helps you:

- **Build Comprehensive Context** - Systematically gather all relevant information
- **Maintain Consistency** - Use standardized formats across your project
- **Improve AI Accuracy** - Provide complete context for better AI-generated code
- **Create Traceable Documentation** - Link decisions, features, specs, and tasks
- **Reduce Rework** - Get it right the first time with well-structured prompts

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Start with Sessions** - Begin each design phase with a clear problem statement
2. **Use Forge Studio** - Visual interface makes creating and organizing files easier
3. **Organize with Folders** - Group related features, specs, and models in nested folders
4. **Link Everything** - Use IDs to create relationships between files (features ↔ specs ↔ models)
5. **Keep Stories Small** - Target < 30 minutes per story for better focus and completion
6. **Review Before Distilling** - Ensure your design (features/specs/models) is complete before generating stories
7. **Define Actors** - Document who interacts with your system for better feature clarity
8. **Use Contexts** - Create context files to guide technical implementation decisions

## 🔮 Future Plans

- Real-time file editing in Studio (currently requires save/reload)
- Drag-and-drop folder reorganization
- Visualization of feature/spec/model relationships
- Template customization for different project types
- Validation and linting for file formats
- Export to various documentation formats (PDF, Confluence, etc.)
- Story execution tracking and status updates
- Enhanced MCP server capabilities with more specialized tools
- AI-assisted content generation for features and specs
