# Brainstorming

## Definition

 The iterative act of Prompt/Research/Answer to complete the files in the `/.cursor/context-engineering/brainstorming` folder.

 ## Instructions

- Analyze all existing content in brainstorming folder and respond to questions as a Product Manager and Technical Manager who needs to define a product implementation plan at a high level and ensure that low level context detail is avilable to fill in knowledge gaps when refinement is performed.
- Generate a high-level phased development strategy. Help me populate `/.cursor/context-engineering/brainstorming/2- Development Phases.md` with very high level phase goals.
- Generate one 'Phase' file in the brainstorming folder for each development phase, with more detailed instructions than what is in the `2- Development Phases.md` file. Continue the numbered file naming approach.

## Goals

 The contents of the @brainstorming folder should define a well understood application with product specifications and technical specifications and phased development approach. At a high level the project is understood. We don't need particlar details like model specifications, but we do need to know where those constructs are documented. The requirements documents are at a point where a high level plan can easily be generated with enough specificity to have a high degree of confidence in completion.

## Restrictions

- Only edit files in the 'brainstorming' folder. Never edit anything outside of that when in 'Brainstorm' mode.
