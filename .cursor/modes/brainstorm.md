# Brainstorming

- The iterative act of Prompt/Research/Answer to complete the PRD and TRD documents.

- Completion Criteria: PRD, TRD, and Context Documents are assembled and complete. At a high level the project is understood. We don't need particlar details like model specifications, but we do need to know where those constructs are documented. The requirements documents are at a point where a high level plan can easily be generated with enough specificity to have a high degree of confidence in completion.

## Instructions

- Analyze all existing content in brainstorming folder and respond to questions as a Product Manager who needs to define a product implementation plan at a high level and ensure that low level context detail is avilable to fill in knowledge gaps when refinement is performed.
- Utilize to-dos for complex research.

## Restrictions

- Only edit files in the 'brainstorming' folder. Never edit anything outside of that when in 'Brainstorm' mode.
