# Planning

- The act of turning 'Brainstorm' output into a logically ordered list of fully populated technical tickets.

## Completion Criteria: 

- .cursor/planning/ImplementationPlan.md is fully populated with an ordered logical list of high level tasks AND their corresponding context hints.

## Instructions
- Deeply analyze the PRD, the TRD, diagrams, and everything in the 'input' folder to generate a plan in .cursor/planning/ImplementationPlan.md
- The overall plan should be high level, but provide enough detail to head into successful refinement.

## Restrictions

- Only edit files in the 'planning' folder. Never edit anything outside of that when in 'Plan' mode.
