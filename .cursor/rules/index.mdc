# Glam

You are helping me build a vscode-extension called "Glam". 

## What it is

Glam helps engineers use proper context engineering to build and maintain software using Agentic development practices. Glam uses a session-driven workflow to track design changes and convert them into minimal, actionable implementation stories.

## The Big Picture

A developer would install Glam at the start of a project. Using Glam, a set of files in a folder named 'ai' in the root of the project would get managed. The folders are:

- ai/sessions
- ai/features
- ai/specs
- ai/models
- ai/contexts
- ai/tickets
- ai/docs

All folders except 'docs' are nestable, and nesting is preferred to maximize contextual structure.

## File Structure

### Sessions (ai/sessions/)
- Session files (*.session.md) track design sessions
- Contains: session_id, start_time, end_time, status, problem_statement, changed_files[]
- Tracks all file changes made during the session

### Features (ai/features/)
- Feature files (*.feature.md) define user-facing functionality
- Uses Gherkin format in code blocks (```gherkin)
- Every features folder should have an index.md with Background and Rules
- Contains: feature_id, spec_id[], model_id[]

### Specs (ai/specs/)
- Spec files (*.spec.md) define technical implementation
- Includes Mermaid diagrams for architecture
- Contains: spec_id, feature_id[], model_id[], context_id[]

### Models (ai/models/)
- Model files (*.model.md) define data structures
- Contains property tables, relationships, validation rules
- Contains: model_id, type, related_models[]

### Contexts (ai/contexts/)
- Context files (*.context.md) provide just-in-time guidance
- Uses Gherkin scenarios in code blocks (```gherkin)
- Tells agents when/how to use specific documentation or tools
- Contains: context_id, category

### Tickets (ai/tickets/)
- Stories (*.story.md) - code implementation work (< 30 minutes each)
- Tasks (*.task.md) - external/manual work
- Organized by session in ai/tickets/<session-id>/
- Contains: story_id/task_id, session_id, feature_id[], spec_id[], model_id[], status

## The Workflow

### Phase 1: Start a Design Session
1. User runs "Glam: Start Design Session" command
2. System prompts for problem statement
3. Creates session file in ai/sessions/ with status: active
4. Session begins tracking changed files

### Phase 2: Design Changes
During an active session, user edits:
- Features (define/modify behavior with Gherkin)
- Specs (technical implementation with Mermaid)
- Models (data structures and properties)
- Contexts (guidance for specific technologies)

All changes are tracked in the session's changed_files array.

### Phase 3: Distill Session
1. User runs "Glam: Distill Session into Stories and Tasks"
2. System generates prompt that:
   - Calls get_glam_about MCP tool
   - Analyzes all changed files
   - Follows context linkages
   - Creates Stories (code) and Tasks (non-code)
   - Places them in ai/tickets/<session-id>/

### Phase 4: Build Implementation
1. User selects a Story file
2. Runs "Glam: Build Story Implementation"
3. System generates prompt with full context from linked features, specs, and models

## Key Principles

### Gherkin Format
ALL Gherkin must use code blocks for consistency:

```gherkin
Feature: User Login

Scenario: Successful login
  Given a registered user
  When they enter valid credentials
  Then they should be logged into the system
  And receive a session token
```

### Minimal Stories
- Each story should take < 30 minutes to implement
- Break complex changes into multiple small stories
- One focused change per story

### Nestable Structure
- All folders are nestable to group related concepts
- Features folders have index.md for shared Background and Rules
- index.md files never show in tree views

### Complete Context
- Stories link to features, specs, and models
- Context files provide technical guidance
- Distillation follows all linkages to gather complete information

## VSCode Commands

The extension provides these commands:

### Glam: Start Design Session
- Accessible from command palette and right-click on 'sessions' folder
- Prompts for problem statement
- Generates prompt to create session file
- Outputs to Glam output panel for copy/paste

### Glam: Distill Session into Stories and Tasks
- Accessible from command palette and right-click on *.session.md files
- Generates comprehensive distillation prompt
- Analyzes all changed files
- Calls get_glam_about to understand workflow
- Creates Stories and Tasks in ai/tickets/<session-id>/

### Glam: Build Story Implementation
- Accessible from command palette and right-click on *.story.md files
- Generates build prompt with full context
- Includes linked features, specs, models, and contexts
- Ready for AI agent to implement

### Glam: Open Glam Studio
- Opens web view with Dashboard, Features, Specs, Models, Contexts, Sessions
- Currently shows basic structure and counts
- Tree views and editors are placeholders for future enhancement

## How Commands Work

Every command generates a prompt that the user copies to the Agent window. Commands do NOT make file changes directly - they create prompts that instruct the agent to make changes.

The prompts are artfully constructed to:
- Call relevant MCP tools (get_glam_about, get_glam_schema, get_glam_context)
- Include all necessary file contents
- Follow context linkages
- Provide clear, specific instructions
- Emphasize minimal story size for distillation

## MCP Server Tools

The @glam/mcp-server provides:

### get_glam_about
Returns comprehensive overview of Glam workflow including:
- Session-driven approach
- When to create Stories vs Tasks
- Minimal story size guidance
- File structure and linkages

### get_glam_schema
Returns schema for: session, feature, spec, model, story, task, context
Each schema includes:
- File format and naming
- Frontmatter fields
- Content structure
- Linkage rules

### get_glam_context
Takes spec_object parameter
Returns guidance for technical objects or research prompt if not found

### get_glam_objects
Lists supported spec objects from guidance library

## Overall Goal

Glam should help users design good prompts with proper context through a session-driven workflow. The prompts generated are intelligent, follow all necessary linkages, and ensure AI agents have complete, accurate context for implementation.

The magic of Glam is in the construction of these prompts and how document linkages are used to generate them with complete context but no overload.
